## Executive Summary

The vision for ibe160 is to create a GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance) platform that feels like an **empowering, efficient, and expert partner**. It moves beyond being a simple database to become an active assistant for compliance professionals.

The core "wow" experience is the proactive **AI Legal Specialist**, which analyzes complex regulatory documents and suggests relevant controls and processes before a human has even started reading. This defining interaction is designed to make the user feel in control, insightful, and significantly more productive.

Our design will be guided by the following principles, synthesized from best-in-class applications:
- **Clarity and Minimalism (Inspired by Apple):** The UI will be clean, professional, and uncluttered, using strong typography and ample whitespace to reduce cognitive load and keep the focus on the data.
- **Actionable, Data-Rich Dashboards (Inspired by Auditboard):** The dashboard will be the customizable heart of the application, providing real-time, role-specific insights with clear, drill-down capabilities.
- **Beautiful, Insightful Data (Inspired by Nordnet):** We will use effective data visualization to transform complex compliance data into clear, beautiful, and immediately understandable insights, without overwhelming the user.

The primary emotional goal is to make the user feel **empowered, in control, efficient, and productive**. The platform will be a desktop-first experience, ensuring a rich, data-centric interface.

## 1. Design System Foundation

### 1.1 Design System Choice

The foundational design system chosen for this project is **Shadcn/UI**.

This decision was based on its unique approach that balances pre-built component structure with deep customizability, aligning perfectly with the project's core UX principles.

### Rationale for Choosing Shadcn/UI

1.  **Alignment with UX Vision:** Shadcn/UI enables the creation of a clean, professional, and "data-first" interface, directly supporting the desired user feeling of being "empowered, in control, and productive." Its minimalist aesthetic is a perfect match for our "authoritative and minimalist" design goal.
2.  **Customizability and Ownership:** Unlike traditional component libraries, Shadcn/UI provides components as code that we copy into our project. This means we have full ownership and control, allowing us to tailor every detail to our specific needs without being locked into a vendor's styling or API.
3.  **Modern Tech Stack Integration:** It is built on modern standards, using Tailwind CSS for styling and Radix UI for accessible primitives. This integrates seamlessly with the project's specified tech stack (Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS).
4.  **Efficiency and Quality:** By providing a curated set of high-quality, accessible components, we accelerate development significantly while ensuring a consistent and robust user experience, avoiding the need to build foundational elements from scratch.

This choice provides the ideal foundation for building a unique, professional, and highly functional user interface that is both scalable and maintainable.

## 2. Core User Experience

### 2.1 Defining Experience

The defining experience of the ibe160 platform—the core "wow" moment that delivers its primary value—is the **proactive AI-powered gap analysis**.

This is the sequence where the user uploads a complex legal or regulatory document and, instead of facing a daunting manual review, is presented with a clear, actionable list of suggested controls and business processes generated by the AI Legal Specialist.

This interaction is the heart of the application and what separates it from a simple database. It's the moment the platform transforms from a passive tool for documentation into an **active, expert partner**. Getting this experience right is the highest priority, as it is the primary driver for making users feel empowered, in control, and efficient. All other features and design decisions are in service to making this core workflow as seamless, trustworthy, and insightful as possible.

### 2.2 Novel UX Patterns

To support the application's defining experience, a novel UX pattern named **"AI Review Mode"** has been designed. This pattern has been refined to incorporate a critical **two-stage approval workflow**, which separates initial AI triage from final business approval. This ensures both efficiency and accountability.

### Stage 1: Compliance Officer (CO) Triage

This stage is focused on speed and allowing a compliance expert to quickly filter the AI's raw output.

1.  **Trigger & Processing:** After a document is uploaded, the CO manually triggers the AI analysis. The UI provides transparent feedback during processing (e.g., "Analyzing Clauses," "Generating Controls").

2.  **Triage Interface:** The CO is presented with the two-panel "AI Review Mode":
    *   **Left Panel:** A list of all raw AI suggestions.
    *   **Right Panel:** Full details of the selected suggestion in an editable form.
    *   **Efficiency Actions:** To facilitate rapid review, "Accept All" and "Dismiss All" batch actions are available. Keyboard shortcuts (e.g., 'J'/'K' for navigation) will be implemented for power users.

3.  **CO Action ("Promote to Review"):** When a CO "Accepts" a suggestion, it is **not** made active. Instead, its status changes to **"Pending Review,"** and it is routed to the appropriate Business Process Owner's queue. A clear confirmation with an icon and text (e.g., "✅ Sent for BPO review") provides immediate feedback.

### Stage 2: Business Process Owner (BPO) Final Approval

This stage is focused on detailed review and accountability by the person who owns the process or control.

1.  **Trigger:** The BPO is notified via their dashboard of items in their "Pending Review" queue.

2.  **Approval Interface:** Clicking a pending item brings the BPO to a view similar to the Review Mode, but framed for final approval. It shows the full details of the item.

3.  **BPO Actions (Final Decision):** The BPO has three options:
    *   **Approve:** Formally accepts the item, changing its status to **"Active."** It now becomes part of the official, live risk and control matrix.
    *   **Edit:** The BPO can make any necessary modifications before approving.
    *   **Discard:** The item is rejected and removed from the workflow. This action is logged for audit purposes.

This two-stage pattern, inspired by the clarity of approval systems like Visma Approval, provides a robust and scalable workflow. It empowers the CO to act as an efficient gatekeeper, while ensuring the BPO retains ultimate authority and accountability.

### Data Persistence and Audit Trail

A critical principle of this pattern is ensuring a complete chain of evidence.

-   **Persistent Source Link:** The "source" link, which points to the specific clause in the source document that triggered the AI suggestion, is treated as permanent metadata.
-   **Workflow Visibility:** This source link is saved when the CO promotes the suggestion to "Pending Review." It is then clearly visible to the BPO during their final approval stage.
-   **Permanent Record:** Once approved by the BPO, the source link remains permanently attached to the active control or risk record. Any user viewing the item in the future will see the original evidence that led to its creation, ensuring full traceability.

## 3. Visual Foundation

### 3.1 Color System

The visual foundation of the application is built on a dual-theme color system, a clear typography hierarchy, and a consistent spacing model. These elements work together to create a professional, accessible, and data-first user experience.

### 1. Color System

The application will support both a Light (default) and a Dark (user-selectable) theme to accommodate user preference and reduce eye strain in data-heavy environments.

#### Light Mode (Default): "Clarity Green"
This theme is designed to feel clean, calm, and positive, using green as the primary indicator for success and progress.

-   **Primary:** `#28a745` (A strong, accessible green for primary actions)
-   **Secondary:** `#17a2b8` (A complementary teal for secondary actions or information)
-   **Semantic Colors:**
    -   Success: `#28a745` (Green)
    -   Warning: `#ffc107` (Yellow)
    -   Error: `#dc3545` (Red)
-   **Neutrals:** A scale of grays will be used for text, backgrounds, and borders to ensure content is legible and the interface is clean.

#### Dark Mode: "Focused Slate"
This theme is modern, sophisticated, and ideal for focusing on data visualizations and reducing eye strain.

-   **Primary:** `#0A84FF` (A vibrant blue that stands out on a dark background)
-   **Secondary:** `#5E5CE6` (A complementary purple for secondary elements)
-   **Semantic Colors:**
    -   Success: `#30D158` (A bright green)
    -   Warning: `#FFD60A` (A vivid yellow)
    -   Error: `#FF453A` (A clear red)
-   **Neutrals:** A scale of dark grays and slate tones will be used for text, backgrounds (`#1C1C1E`), and surfaces (`#2C2C2E`) to create a sense of depth and focus.

### 2. Typography

The typography system is designed for maximum readability and a clear information hierarchy.

-   **Font Families:**
    -   **Body & Headings:** A system font stack (`-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Roboto, "Helvetica Neue", Arial, sans-serif`) will be used for its high legibility and native performance.
    -   **Monospace:** A standard monospace stack (`"SFMono-Regular", Consolas, "Liberation Mono", Menlo, monospace`) will be used for code snippets or tabular data where alignment is critical.
-   **Type Scale:** A clear and consistent scale (e.g., H1: 36px, H2: 28px, H3: 24px, Body: 16px, Small: 14px) will be used to establish a strong visual hierarchy.
-   **Font Weights:**
    -   **Headings:** Bold (600 or 700)
    -   **Body:** Normal (400)
    -   **Labels/Emphasis:** Medium (500) or Semi-bold (600)

### 3. Spacing & Layout

A consistent spacing system will be used to create a visually rhythmic and organized layout.

-   **Base Unit:** **8px**. All spacing values (padding, margins, gaps) will be multiples of 8px.
-   **Scale:** A defined scale (e.g., `spacing-1`=8px, `spacing-2`=16px, `spacing-3`=24px) will be used by developers to ensure consistency and eliminate arbitrary values. This creates a predictable and professional visual structure.

## 4. Design Direction

### 4.1 Chosen Design Approach

After a thorough review of three distinct visual concepts, a final hybrid design direction was chosen. This approach combines the strongest elements of **"Direction 1: The Focused Dashboard"** and **"Direction 3: The Action-Oriented Hub"** to create an interface that is both professional and highly efficient.

### The Hybrid Design Approach

The chosen design provides a scalable structure with a modern, task-focused user experience.

1.  **Primary Layout & Navigation (from Direction 1):** The application will use a professional layout featuring a **collapsible left-hand sidebar** for main navigation. This provides a consistent and predictable structure that can easily scale as more features are added. The ability to collapse the sidebar gives users the flexibility to maximize their content area, which is crucial for reviewing dense data.

2.  **Dashboard Experience (from Direction 3):** The main dashboard will be designed as an **"Action-Oriented Hub."** Instead of a static report, the dashboard will feature a grid of modular cards representing the user's most immediate tasks and priorities (e.g., "Pending Reviews," "High-Priority Risks"). This makes the entry point of the application highly engaging and functional.

3.  **Core Action Placement (from Direction 3):** A prominent **"Analyze New Document" button** will be placed on the main dashboard. This elevates the application's most critical feature, making it immediately accessible and reinforcing its importance in the user's workflow.

4.  **Data Display (from Direction 1):** When drilling down from the dashboard into specific data sets (e.g., viewing a full list of risks), the UI will use clean, structured **data tables**. This approach is ideal for presenting dense, sortable information in a clear and professional manner.

5.  **AI Review Mode (from Direction 1):** The two-panel layout for the AI Review Mode is confirmed and will be a cornerstone of the design, providing a focused environment for reviewing AI suggestions.

### Rationale

This hybrid direction was chosen because it successfully marries the robust, scalable navigation of a traditional professional application with a modern, modular, and task-focused dashboard. It provides the structure needed for a complex GRC tool while ensuring the user experience is direct, intuitive, and efficient.

## 5. User Journey Flows

### 5.1 Critical User Paths

This section documents the critical user journeys, defining the step-by-step user experience for the most important workflows in the application.

### Journey 1: AI-Powered Gap Analysis

This is the core workflow of the application, detailing how a Compliance Officer (CO) processes a new regulatory document and routes AI-generated suggestions to the appropriate Business Process Owners (BPOs) for final approval. The journey follows a deliberate "Send & Notify" model.

**Actor:** Compliance Officer (CO)
**Goal:** To analyze a new document, triage AI suggestions, and formally send them to BPOs for review.

#### Step-by-Step Flow:

1.  **Initiate Analysis:** From the main dashboard, the CO clicks the prominent **"Analyze New Document"** button.
2.  **Upload Document:** The CO is presented with an upload interface and selects a regulatory document (e.g., PDF, TXT) from their local machine.
3.  **AI Processing:** The system shows clear feedback that the AI is working, displaying the current stage of analysis (e.g., "Analyzing Clauses," "Generating Controls").
4.  **Triage in "AI Review Mode":** Upon completion, the CO enters the two-panel "AI Review Mode." They efficiently review the list of suggestions, using **"Accept"** to keep promising suggestions or **"Dismiss"** to discard irrelevant ones. Batch actions ("Accept All") are available for high-confidence results.
5.  **Finish Triage:** Once the CO has reviewed all suggestions, they click a **"Finish Review"** button.
6.  **Summary & Assignment View:** The CO is taken to a summary screen. This screen lists all the suggestions they "Accepted," automatically grouped by the suggested BPO who will be assigned the review.
7.  **Send for Review:** After a final look, the CO clicks the definitive **"Send for Review"** button.
8.  **Handoff & Notification:** The system officially routes the items to the respective BPOs' "Pending Review" queues and sends out notifications (e.g., email, in-app) to alert them of their new tasks.
