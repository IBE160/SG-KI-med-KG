## Executive Summary

The vision for ibe160 is to create a GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance) platform that feels like an **empowering, efficient, and expert partner**. It moves beyond being a simple database to become an active assistant for compliance professionals.

The core "wow" experience is the proactive **AI Legal Specialist**, which analyzes complex regulatory documents and suggests relevant controls and processes before a human has even started reading. This defining interaction is designed to make the user feel in control, insightful, and significantly more productive.

Our design will be guided by the following principles, synthesized from best-in-class applications:
- **Clarity and Minimalism (Inspired by Apple):** The UI will be clean, professional, and uncluttered, using strong typography and ample whitespace to reduce cognitive load and keep the focus on the data.
- **Actionable, Data-Rich Dashboards (Inspired by Auditboard):** The dashboard will be the customizable heart of the application, providing real-time, role-specific insights with clear, drill-down capabilities.
- **Beautiful, Insightful Data (Inspired by Nordnet):** We will use effective data visualization to transform complex compliance data into clear, beautiful, and immediately understandable insights, without overwhelming the user.

The primary emotional goal is to make the user feel **empowered, in control, efficient, and productive**. The platform will be a desktop-first experience, ensuring a rich, data-centric interface.

## 1. Design System Foundation

### 1.1 Design System Choice

The foundational design system chosen for this project is **Shadcn/UI**.

This decision was based on its unique approach that balances pre-built component structure with deep customizability, aligning perfectly with the project's core UX principles.

### Rationale for Choosing Shadcn/UI

1.  **Alignment with UX Vision:** Shadcn/UI enables the creation of a clean, professional, and "data-first" interface, directly supporting the desired user feeling of being "empowered, in control, and productive." Its minimalist aesthetic is a perfect match for our "authoritative and minimalist" design goal.
2.  **Customizability and Ownership:** Unlike traditional component libraries, Shadcn/UI provides components as code that we copy into our project. This means we have full ownership and control, allowing us to tailor every detail to our specific needs without being locked into a vendor's styling or API.
3.  **Modern Tech Stack Integration:** It is built on modern standards, using Tailwind CSS for styling and Radix UI for accessible primitives. This integrates seamlessly with the project's specified tech stack (Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS).
4.  **Efficiency and Quality:** By providing a curated set of high-quality, accessible components, we accelerate development significantly while ensuring a consistent and robust user experience, avoiding the need to build foundational elements from scratch.

This choice provides the ideal foundation for building a unique, professional, and highly functional user interface that is both scalable and maintainable.

## 2. Core User Experience

### 2.1 Defining Experience

The defining experience of the ibe160 platform—the core "wow" moment that delivers its primary value—is the **proactive AI-powered gap analysis**.

This is the sequence where the user uploads a complex legal or regulatory document and, instead of facing a daunting manual review, is presented with a clear, actionable list of suggested controls and business processes generated by the AI Legal Specialist.

This interaction is the heart of the application and what separates it from a simple database. It's the moment the platform transforms from a passive tool for documentation into an **active, expert partner**. Getting this experience right is the highest priority, as it is the primary driver for making users feel empowered, in control, and efficient. All other features and design decisions are in service to making this core workflow as seamless, trustworthy, and insightful as possible.

### 2.2 Novel UX Patterns

To support the application's defining experience, a novel UX pattern named **"AI Review Mode"** has been designed. This pattern has been refined to incorporate a critical **two-stage approval workflow**, which separates initial AI triage from final business approval. This ensures both efficiency and accountability.

### Stage 1: Compliance Officer (CO) Triage

This stage is focused on speed and allowing a compliance expert to quickly filter the AI's raw output.

1.  **Trigger & Processing:** After a document is uploaded, the CO manually triggers the AI analysis. The UI provides transparent feedback during processing (e.g., "Analyzing Clauses," "Generating Controls").

2.  **Triage Interface:** The CO is presented with the two-panel "AI Review Mode":
    *   **Left Panel:** A list of all raw AI suggestions.
    *   **Right Panel:** Full details of the selected suggestion in an editable form.
    *   **Efficiency Actions:** To facilitate rapid review, "Accept All" and "Dismiss All" batch actions are available. Keyboard shortcuts (e.g., 'J'/'K' for navigation) will be implemented for power users.

3.  **CO Action ("Promote to Review"):** When a CO "Accepts" a suggestion, it is **not** made active. Instead, its status changes to **"Pending Review,"** and it is routed to the appropriate Business Process Owner's queue. A clear confirmation with an icon and text (e.g., "✅ Sent for BPO review") provides immediate feedback.

### Stage 2: Business Process Owner (BPO) Final Approval

This stage is focused on detailed review and accountability by the person who owns the process or control.

1.  **Trigger:** The BPO is notified via their dashboard of items in their "Pending Review" queue.

2.  **Approval Interface:** Clicking a pending item brings the BPO to a view similar to the Review Mode, but framed for final approval. It shows the full details of the item.

3.  **BPO Actions (Final Decision):** The BPO has three options:
    *   **Approve:** Formally accepts the item, changing its status to **"Active."** It now becomes part of the official, live risk and control matrix.
    *   **Edit:** The BPO can make any necessary modifications before approving.
    *   **Discard:** The item is rejected and removed from the workflow. This action is logged for audit purposes.

This two-stage pattern, inspired by the clarity of approval systems like Visma Approval, provides a robust and scalable workflow. It empowers the CO to act as an efficient gatekeeper, while ensuring the BPO retains ultimate authority and accountability.

### Data Persistence and Audit Trail

A critical principle of this pattern is ensuring a complete chain of evidence.

-   **Persistent Source Link:** The "source" link, which points to the specific clause in the source document that triggered the AI suggestion, is treated as permanent metadata.
-   **Workflow Visibility:** This source link is saved when the CO promotes the suggestion to "Pending Review." It is then clearly visible to the BPO during their final approval stage.
-   **Permanent Record:** Once approved by the BPO, the source link remains permanently attached to the active control or risk record. Any user viewing the item in the future will see the original evidence that led to its creation, ensuring full traceability.
