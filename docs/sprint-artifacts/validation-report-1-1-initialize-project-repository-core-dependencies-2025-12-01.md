# Story Quality Validation Report

Story: 1-1-initialize-project-repository-core-dependencies - Initialize Project Repository & Core Dependencies
Outcome: PASS with issues (Critical: 0, Major: 0, Minor: 2)

## Critical Issues (Blockers)

None

## Major Issues (Should Fix)

None

## Minor Issues (Nice to Have)

- **Testing Subtasks Missing:** While tasks are mapped to Acceptance Criteria, explicit testing subtasks (e.g., a subtask for manually verifying `docker compose up`) are not present for each. For a foundational story, this is a minor omission.
- **Change Log Missing:** The story file does not contain a `## Change Log` section at the end. While not critical for a first draft, it's good practice to include it for future updates.

## Successes

- The story correctly identifies itself as the first in the epic, with no predecessor context.
- All relevant and existing source documents (Tech Spec, Epics, Architecture) are correctly cited with section headers.
- Acceptance Criteria are clear, testable, and correctly derived from source documents.
- Dev Notes provide specific, actionable guidance based on the architecture document.
- The overall file structure and metadata are correct.
