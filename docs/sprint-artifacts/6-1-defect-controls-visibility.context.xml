      <note>Frontend: `frontend/app/dashboard/controls/page.tsx`</note>
      <note>Backend Endpoint: Likely a `GET` on a controls resource. Check `backend/app/api` or `backend/app/routes`.</note>
      <note>Suspect issue in `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/suggestions.py` (approval logic) or the fetching logic.</note>
