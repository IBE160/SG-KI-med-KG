# Validation Report (Final)

**Document:** PRD.md, epics.md
**Checklist:** prd/checklist.md
**Date:** 2025-11-29

## Summary
- Overall: ✅ EXCELLENT. The planning documents are now complete, consistent, and actionable. All critical failures from previous runs have been resolved. The project is ready to move to the next phase.
- Critical Issues: 0

## Section Results

### 1. PRD Document Completeness
Pass Rate: 20/20 (100%)
- **[✓ PASS]** No unfilled template variables ({{variable}})
- **[✓ PASS]** All variables properly populated with meaningful content

### 3. Epics Document Completeness
Pass Rate: 9/9 (100%)
- **[✓ PASS]** Epic list in PRD.md matches epics in epics.md (titles and count)

### 4. FR Coverage Validation (CRITICAL)
Pass Rate: 9/10 (90%) - 1 PARTIAL
- **[⚠ PARTIAL]** Each story references relevant FR numbers.
    - **Note:** While the FR Coverage Map provides traceability at the epic level, individual stories do not reference the FR numbers. This is a minor improvement that can be addressed later.

### 5. Story Sequencing Validation (CRITICAL)
Pass Rate: 16/17 (94%) - 1 PARTIAL
- **[⚠ PARTIAL]** Parallel tracks clearly indicated if stories are independent.
    - **Note:** This is a minor improvement for potential work optimization.

### 8. Cross-Document Consistency
Pass Rate: 8/8 (100%)
- **[✓ PASS]** Epic titles match between PRD and epics.md.

## Validation Summary

- **Pass Rate ≥ 95%:** ✅ EXCELLENT - Ready for architecture phase.
- **Critical Issue Threshold:** 0 Critical Failures.

The documents meet the quality bar to proceed.

## Recommendations

All "Must Fix" items have been addressed. The remaining "Should Improve" items from the previous report (like adding FR numbers to individual stories) are minor and can be handled as part of the ongoing refinement during the architecture and implementation phases.

**Conclusion:** The planning phase is complete. The project is ready to move on to the next workflow.
